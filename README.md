This repository investigates the behavior of the labor market in the United States during the COVID-19 crisis. We download the data through the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) API for the US and all its states to compare the data within them over time and across states. We also aim to detect any potential effect of different policies in generating diverging labor market trends in those states.

This is part of the QuantEcon class at NYU called Data Skills for Computational Social Science, taught by Drs. Thomas Sargent, Spencer Lyon and Chase Coleman.
